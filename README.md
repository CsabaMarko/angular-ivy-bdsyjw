[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-bdsyjw)

## Tasks

1. The header "Hello Angular 13!" is duplicated. Makes sure it is shown only once!

2. Complete the implementation: so that SenderComponent may send strings to the ReceiverComponent. From the UI point of view: the (filled) value in the text input box should be displayed under the "Receiver", when the user clicks on the "send" button. (You may simply add each new string to a new line, or show them as `<li>` elements.)

3. (Based on #2) Additionally to solution #2: Make sure that if the input box is empty, the sent string value will be this literal: `(empty)`

4. (extra) Styling task: The Sender and the Receiver components should be placed next to each other (unlike now.) We would prefer Bootstrap, but you may use other tools as well.
